Wash dishes with dishwasher
I walk to the kitchen and find the dishwasher. I open it. I find the sink and grab the dirty plates, cups, bowls, and utensils. I rinse off the dirty dishes under the faucet. I then place the dirty dishes into the dishwasher. I add soap to the dishwasher and close the lid. I turn it on and wait.
