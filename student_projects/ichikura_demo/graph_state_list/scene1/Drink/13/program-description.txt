Drink
I walk to the kitchen and open the cabinet containing the drinking glasses. I grab a drinking glass and close the cabinet. I bring the glass to the sink and turn on the faucet to cold. I move the glass under the stream of water and keep it there until the glass is 80% full of water. I move the glass away from the stream of water and shut off the faucet. I bring the cup to my mouth and drink the water.
