Check email
I pull out my office chair and sit down. I use my desktop computer to log into my email account. I scroll down the list of emails in my in box. If there is something i would like to read, i then click on that email and read it. If i need to reply to it, i will click on "reply" and type in my reply and press send. If not, i may just delete the junk mail by putting a check next to the ones i want to delete, and then pressing "delete". I will repeat this process until i have finished looking through all the emails.
