Wash dishes by hand
I enter the kitchen, walk to the sink, turn on the faucet, grab the sponge and get it wet, then apply dish soap to the sponge. I take a dish, scrub it with the sponge, rinse it, and place it on the dish rack to dry, and repeat until all the dishes are clean. I rinse the sponge, put it down, and turn off the faucet.
