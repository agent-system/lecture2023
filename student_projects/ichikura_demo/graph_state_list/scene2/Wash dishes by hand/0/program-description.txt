Wash dishes by hand
I go to the kitchen and turn on the faucet. I get dish soap and put it into the sink. I grab a sponge and a bowl and start cleaning it. I put the bowl into the dishrack. I find a plate and clean it as well. I put it into the dishrack, turn off the faucet and put the sponge back.
